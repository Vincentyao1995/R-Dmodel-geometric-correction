# R-Dmodel-geometric-correction
This project helps to correct radar SAR image using DEM, which contains longtitude and latidude infomation. You could see basic principle in doc.
Note: cuz the data is confidential. SAR img is a .img or .bmp file which contains irradiance, and parameter.txt is obtained from SAR img's head file. You should change this parameter.txt into your own one. DEM is GeoTiff, which should be operated by GDAL lib.
